# Equality
    '==' - compares values after data type conversion.  
    '====' - compares to exact value, no conversion

# Asyncj JS/ Callback functions
    Call a function and within a parameter you call another function. Async JS uses promises utilizing .then/.catch so the user does not have to go to callback hell.  Additionally, await syntax was set up to wait for data to come back in the code, eliminating the need for a .then/.catch

# Error Handling
    try/catch , attempt something and if it errors out, it'll do the catch action. Consider writing defensive code, always being cognisant of errors and using appropriate error handling

# ES6 syntax
    destructuring -
    spread operator - [...array]
    template literal - uses backticks (left of 1 key: `), string literals from python
    Array methods - array data methods for simplifying ways to manipulate array
