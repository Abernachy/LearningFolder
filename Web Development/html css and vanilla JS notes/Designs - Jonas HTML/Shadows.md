# Shadows

Shadow creates depth(3d): the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element is.

They can be used on box and text elements.

## Use Shadows Well

1.  You don't have to use shadows. Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality.

```
Less Shadows                                        More Shadows
--------------------------------------------------------------->
Serious/Elegant                                       Playful/Fun

```

2.  Use shadows in small doses. Dont add shadows to every element!

3.  Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark.

## When to use Shadows

4.  Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand (to draw attention)

5.  Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more

6.  Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface.

7.  Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)

8.  Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
