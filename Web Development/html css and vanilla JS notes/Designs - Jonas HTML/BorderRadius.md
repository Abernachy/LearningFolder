# Border Radius

## Use border-radius well

1.  Use border radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to make it less serious (works exactly like shadows)

2.  typefaces have a certain roundess: make sure that border-radius matches that roundess

3.  Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections, and other elements.
