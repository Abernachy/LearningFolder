## Technical details with using iamges

10. To account for _high-res screens_, make image dimensions _2x as big_ as their displayed size.
    Scale Factor: Actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represented on screen
    On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x - 3x , on normal screens it's just 1x
    If we do not do this, the visible image can become balls blurry
