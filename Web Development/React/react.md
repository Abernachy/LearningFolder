# REACt

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces that gives you tools for interacting wtih the DOM that are cleaner and more performant than raw javascript or jQuery.It uses declarative language compared to imperative language.

```
const element = <h1>Hellow, World!</h1>
```
React is used on popular websites like Instagram and Facebook (the folks who developed it).  

Applications with React can be built in a few different ways:

## Single Page Application (SPA)

A web application that rewrites the current page when the user's interactions require a change, rather than making a request to a remote server("round-trip"), to update client-side content.
