# Getting shit done as a developer - 8 habits
These bits come from Fun Fun Function videos, who sadly no longer produces content on youtube as of Summer 2020


# Why
At its essence, coding is not about programming, its about helping people.
We can't look at it as us working for money, because we tend to get into a thought of servitude

We have to look at ourselves as not working, but providing another person something they need.  This changes our mindset around to one of helping, rather than working.
