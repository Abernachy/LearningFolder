# WTF is docker?
  Docker is an application designed to run and build containers.  A container, in this case, is a separate ecosystem of an OS that has applications already installed.


## Why?

  The main purpose behind the use of this is to eliminate the need to have to wade through installing setting up your development / running environment.  Additionally,
  if your container is working and running, it will run on anyones system as everything that is needed is part of the container.

  Containers typically are standardized, lightweight, secure, and (ideally) are portable.



Containers get their names from basically shipping containers.  They are shipped across a network and are usable upon arrival.  


## Basic commands and practices
    $ docker pull "container name"  => will pull the request image from docker hub.
