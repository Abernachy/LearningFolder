## General Programming

1.  Programming fundamentals -> The basic for how the language works (If Statements, For Loops, While Loops, Functions, Conditions, etc)
    Personal Goal: [X] Javascript => for use with Web Applications
    [ ] Python => Can be used to create web sites and for scriptings tools
    [ ] C# => Can play a part as I'm learning and diving more into MS products like SharePoint and Power Apps

2.  Object Oriented Programming => A style of programming that goes off of classes and objects
    Personal Goal:

3.  Static Typing => Understanding the differences between languages that statically typed vs dynamically typed
    Personal Goal: [ ] C# is a statically typed language
    [ ] Python / Javascript are dynamically typed languages

4.  Programming Paradigms => Knowing some of the different types of programming paradigms (Object Oriented vs Functional, etc)

5.  Asynchronous Programming => Able to do things in code based on events rather than processor clock speed.
    Python and Javascript have Async/Await capabilities

6.  Concurrency => ability of different parts of a program to be executed out of order or at the same time without affecting the final outcome

7.  Parallelism => techniques to make programs faster by performing several computations at the same time

## Data Structures and Algorithism

1. Time Complexity Analysis => Look at a block of code and know how fast it will run
   Big O Notation / Big Theta Notation / etc **This is important, unfortunately**

2. Dat Structures => Arrays / Stacks / Queues /Priority Queue / Linked List /Hash Tables
   Trees => AVL / Binary / Binary Search / B- / B+
   Heaps => Min /Max / Implementation / Graphs / Graph Theory
   Sets and Set Theory
   **This is also important, unfortunately**

3 Algorithim analysis **You need to understand the top 2 first before this**
=> Ability to look at 2 algorithims and figure out which ones work better
Ability to use algorithims to solve problems

## Design

Given details of a system, come up with the design to implement the system
UML modeling / Activity Diagram / State Diagram / User Flow Diagram

1. Model a system => Come up with the diagrams of it
2. Design principles => What you want to think about when writing code
3. Design Patterns => The common design patterns : Oberserver PAttern / Singleton /Decorator / Subscriber pattern

## Tools

[x] Git / Version control
[ ] Linux Commands => Basic linux commands
[ ] IDES => VS code

## Databases

[x] 1. SQL => Understand basic stuff about SQL 2. Database Design = > How you can design a database to solve simple things like how to store the data more effectively

## Web Technologies

    [x] 1. HTTP / HTTP Methods => CRUD operations
          What are Headers ?
          What is a response body?
          What is a request body?
          query parameters

    [x] 2. APIs / JSON

        3. Client-Server Model

        4. Basic Networking
