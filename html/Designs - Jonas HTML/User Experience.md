# User Experience

## What is User Experience?

Steve Jobs => "Design is not just what it looks like, and feels like. Design is how it works"

The UI is the visual presentation of a product, so it is all about Layout, "Personality", Typography, colors, fonts, etc.

The User experience is the overall experience the user has while interacting with the product.

For UX design we typically ask a few questions with the app:

- Does the App feel logical and well though out?
- Does the navigation work intuitively?
- Are users reaching their goal?

## UI and UX Design

UI => UI design is what makes an interface beautiful
UX => UX is what makes an interface useful and functional

\*UX design can not exist without UI Design
