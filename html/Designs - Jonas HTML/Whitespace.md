# Whitespace

Space between elements

1.  The right amount of whitepsace makes designs look clearn, modern, and polished.

2.  Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are related to one another

3.  White space implies invisible relationships between the elements of a layout

## Where to use whitespace

1.  Use white space between sections

2.  Use a lot whitespace between groups of elements

3.  Use whitespace between elements

4.  Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines

## How much white space

1.  The more elemetns (or group of elements) belong together, the closer they should be (law of proximity)

2.  Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much. Then remove whitespace from there.  
    Too much white space looks detached, too little looks too crammed.

3.  Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace
