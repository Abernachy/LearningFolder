# Visual Hierarchy

Establishing which elements of design are the most important ones.

It's about drawing attention to the most important elements.

It's also about defining a 'path' for users, to guide them through the page.

We use a combination of position, size, colors, spaving, borders, and shadows to establish a visual hierarchy between elements and components.

## Fundamentals

1.  Position important elements closer to the top of the page, where they get more attention.

2.  Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (bigger = more attention)

3.  Use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements

## Visual hierarchy for text elements

1.  For text elements, use font size, font weight, color, and whitespace to convey importance.

2.  What text elements to emphazize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons.
    1.  You can also de-emphasize less important text, like labels or secondary/additional information

## Visual hierarchy between components

3. Emphasize important componen using background color, shadow, or border (or mulitple)

4. Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B.

5. What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables in etc
