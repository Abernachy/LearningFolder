# Color Notes

## Rules

1.  Make sure the main color matches the websites personality, colors convey meaning

Red -> Draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion and excitement
Orange -> Similiar to red, but less aggresive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
Yellow => joys, brightness, and intelligence
Green => harmony, nature, growth, and health
Blue => associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
Purple => wealth, wisdom, and magic
Pink => romance, care, and affection
Brown => nature, durability, and comfort
Black -> symbolizes power, elegance, and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow (most difficult color to work with)

2. Use a good color tone, don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors
   Tool options: Open Color , Tailwind CSS , Flat UI Colors 2

3. You need atleast two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color
4. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent (secondary) colors (use a tool)

5. For diversity, create ligher and darker "versions" ( tints and shades)
   Tools: Tint and Shade Generator, Palleton.com, Coolers

### When and how to use your colors?

6.  Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.

7.  Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out

8.  You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations (making the main color appear to be part of the illustration)

### Colors and Typography

9.  On dark colord background, try to use a tint of the background ("ligher version") for the text

10. Text should not be completely black. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting.

11. Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors.
    Contrast ratio needs to be be atleast 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text(18px+)
