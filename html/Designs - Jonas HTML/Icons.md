# Icons

## Use good icons

1. Use a good icon pack
   Resources: Phosphor Icons , Ionicons, Icons58

2. Use only one icon pack. Do not mix icons from different packs.

3. Only use icons in the SVG format or Icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png). SVG are vector based and can scale indefinitely.

4. Icons need to adjust to website personality. Roundess and weight, and filled/outline depend on typography.

## When to use Icons

1. Use icons to provide visual assistance to text.

2. Use icoins for product feature blocks

3. Use icons associated with actions and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear).

4. Use icons as bullet points

## Use Icons well

1. To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use a different color

2. Don't confuse your users; icons need to make sense and fit the text or action.

3. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.
