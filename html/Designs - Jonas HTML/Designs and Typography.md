## General design notes

### Typography

Serif vs Sans-Serif:
Serif - typeface has small details like the tails at the end of texts. They can be used to make a more traditional / classic look and feel. They work good for long text, and convey trust worthiness

Sans-Serif - does not have the decorative lines. They look clean and simple and work good for a modern and good feeling design. Gives a clean and simple design, and eaier to choose for beginner designers.

It's easier to choose a Sans-Serif design that fits a design vs finding and choosing a Serif design.

Rules:

1 => **Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe**:
Sans-Serif font ideas: Inter, Open-Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato
Serif font ideas: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cardo, Lora

Note: Another good Sans-serif idea is Poppins. I got it from a UX/UI designer youtube video about aliens taking over the planet and they recommended poppins.

2=> _It is okey to use just one typeface per page_! If you use more than that, limit it to 2.

3=> _Choose the right typeface according to the website personality_.
Choose the site personality
Decide between a serif and sans-seriff typeface
Experiment with all the "good" typefaces to see which ones best fits your website's messages.
You can keep trying you different typefaces as you design and build the page.

4 => _When choosing font-sizes, limit choices!._ Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range

5 => _Use a font size between 16px and 32 px for "normal" text._

6 => _For long text (like a blog post) , try a size of 20px or even bigger_

7 => For big headlines, you can go really big (50px) and bold (600+), depending on personality

8=> _For any text, don't use a font weight under 400_ (regular)

### Create a Good reading experience

9 => Use less than 75 characters per line

10 => For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5.
The smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be.

11=> Decrease letter spacing in headlines if it looks unnatural. This will come with experience.

12 => Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter spacing.

13 => Usually, don't justify text.

14 => Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.
