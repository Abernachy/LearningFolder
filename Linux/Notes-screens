Monitors are blacked out even if they are connected:



So basically somtimes the screens for the dock will go black, and nothing seems to be getting them back on.  Here are some steps I did to hopefully remedy the issue in the future.

xrandr  ( whch shows your display data when you run it without any options. The Left monitor is DVI-I-2-2 and the right is DVI-I-1-1)

If you see the monitors in the xrandr command output:

xrandr --output (name [ DVI-I-1-1/etc) -- off  => turns the monitor off
xrandr --output --auto  => will turn it back on and will reet the settings though, so you'll have to reposition them.

Thats my known fix for the issue, when/if I develop a bash script for it, I'll paste it here

The Display Link USB-C dock and the issues with it

All right.  So I took some time to fuck with the USB-C dock that I got a few months back.  It's a decent dock, the big problem is the display-link software.  So the basic idea is that display-link uses cpu to help leverage your GPU for outputting to multiple screens.  It seems to work fine on Windows, on Linux their support is kind of garbage, with the software eating 50% of the cpu while it's running.

The fix?
  Don't fucking use it.  As long as your USB-C dongle is connected to the Thunderbolt 3 port, the HDMI output will output to another monitor, assuming you have the main HDMI port already being used.  The experience is significantly better and everything runs a lot smoother.  I should have never bought the damn dock.
